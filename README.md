## Usage Examples

The file `example.pdf` contains the result of these examples. `example.tex` is the compilable version.

1. **Basic Page Styles**:

   Create simple note-taking templates with different backgrounds:
   ```latex
   \notebookpage{fill dotted,paginate}
   \notebookpage{fill squares,paginate}
   \notebookpage{fill lines,paginate}
   \notebookpage{fill crosses,paginate}
   ```

2. **Advanced Layouts**:

   Combine various elements for a more structured approach:
   ```latex
   \notebookpage{
     box={A full width box},
     todo=2,
     columns={Column 1/2,Column 2/3,Col 3/1},
     fill dotted, paginate
   }
   ```

   For journaling or detailed planning with added visual elements:
   ```latex
   \notebookpage{
     box={A full width box},
     todo={[bottom,fill=gray!30]2},
     columns={Column 1/2,Column 2/3,Col 3/1},
     fill crosses, time codes,paginate,
     label={north east}{Journal},
   }
   ```

3. **Calendar Integration**:

   Embed and customize calendars within your templates:
   ```latex
   \pgfcalendarcalc{\year-\month-\day}{\ThisDay}
   \pgfcalendarcalc{\year-\month-last+1}{\NextMonth}
   \pgfcalendarcalc{\Y-\M-last+1}{\NextMonth}

   \notebookpage{
     calendar=\ThisDay,
     fill elem={},
     every label/.append style={font=\Huge},
     label={center}{\Y\\\pgfcalendarmonthname{\M}},
     calendar/next week/.style={},
     calendar/gone/.style={},
     calendar/weekend/.style={green!50!black,font=\bfseries},
     calendar={[bottom,fill=green!10]{\NextMonth}},
     paginate,
   }
   ```
   
   Instead of a calendar block, you can also print a line for every day of the month:
   
   ```latex
   \pgfcalendarcalc{\year-\month-\day}{\ThisDay}
   \notebookpage{
       month list={\ThisDay}{Column 1/2,Column 2/3},
       paginate={\ThisDay{} -- \thepage}
   }
   ```

4. **Custom Canvas Settings**:

   Apply specific canvas styles for enhanced functionality:
   ```latex
   \nbkeys{
     every canvas/.style={/notebook/.cd, foldmark,punchmarks={65mm/2,110mm/2}} 
   }
   \notebookpage{fill dotted}
   ```

## Hardware Recommendations

- For my physical binder, I use a [FlexiNotes](https://www.flexinotes.de) notebook, which I can highly recommend.

- For my handwriting, I use a **Lamy logo** fountain pen with the extra fine (EF) tip. The pen looks elegant and takes up one of those large Lamy ink cartridges.

- Do never ask me about 4-hole perforators for DIN A5 paper...
